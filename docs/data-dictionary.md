## How Records Link Together

Every account record (DDA, Loan, CD, Debit Card) has a `cif_number` field that references the Contact or Company it belongs to. This is the glue that connects a person to their products.

> **Note:** Formal HubSpot associations (the visual links between records) are not yet implemented. The `cif_number` field exists on all objects and can be used to cross-reference.
